# Contact-management-sysyem
ðŸ“‡ Just completed my third task for the CodSoft internship! ðŸ’¼
I've built a Contact Management System using Python with a Tkinter front-end and MySQL as the back-end database. This project includes a range of essential features like adding, searching, updating, and deleting contacts. It's a practical and user-friendly solution for managing contacts efficiently.
I'm excited to showcase my skills in both front-end and back-end development, creating a real-world application that can simplify contact management for users.
